Hello,

Several people already offered to maintain lucane (three, if I
remember correctly). After giving them the various admin rights, they
all vanished, so this time, I'll ask before.

What do you intend to do exactly ? Bugfixes only, or do you already
know how you can improve the codebase and the website ?
Do you already have some clients interested in lucane ?

BTW, i made a few improvements recently, and migrated the source
repository to mercurial :
http://freehg.org/u/vfiack/lucane/

The codebase was migrated to maven2, plugins & services classes have
specific annotations so that we don't have to set these metadata in
each translation file, the server is manageable with JMX, and a few
small changes.

If you have more ideas, we can probably work together.

Have a nice day,
Vincent.
